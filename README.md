# Computational Neuroscience

This project gathers a set of Jupyter notebooks focused on computational analysis and modeling techniques in the field of neuroscience. The main objective is to explore neuroscientific data through computational methods, practical experiments, and interactive visualizations.


# Content

The notebooks located in the notebooks folder cover the following topics:


- Neuronal models: Implementation and simulation of computational models to represent neural dynamics.

- Neuroscientific data analysis: Processing, visualization, and interpretation of real or simulated datasets.

- Machine learning and neural network techniques applied to neurocomputational problems.

- Practical experiments detailed step-by-step to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

# How to Use

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/thiagoribeiro00/neuroscience-computational.git
